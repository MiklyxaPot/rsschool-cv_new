Briefly About Myself:

I started to get interested in web programming at the beginning of the year, because I was looking for a job that would not give me independence from where I traveled. I was interested in the frontend because it is a good start to get into programming. Programming is a growing area that is interesting from the point of view of my personal development and is in demand in the market.
I love to hear and believe that the effort you put in always pays off.

```
